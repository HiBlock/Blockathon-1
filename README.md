## What is a Blockathon?
Blockathon = Blockchain + Hackathon. 

Blockchain encompassing the technology driving the new age of trust and decentralisation and hackathon being an event in which anyone from any field can come together and work on a project in a given timeframe. By combining the two, you get an event where people come together and work on meaningful projects for the Blockchain.

Whether you are a Hacker (programmers), Hipster (Growth/User Interface/User Experience), Hustler (Business XX) + Academic, anyone is welcome to participate. Blockathons have been founded on the principles to further develop the Blockchain community, coming together with like-minded individuals and learning from one another.

The only way to grow in life is by XXX.

Blockathons typically last between a day to a week in length, depending on the event. The ideas that people work on can either be pre-planned or formed on the day of the event. Depending on the Blockathon, there may be a specific focus which can include the programming language used, the operating system, an application, an API, the subject and the demographic group of the programmers. In other cases, there is no restriction on the type of software being created. Today, this term is not related to "hacking", it is just a programming marathon.

Before the event text blurb

## Reason 
🔴🔴

## Organising Team 
Your organising team is the most important foundation for running a successful blockathon. You will all be working together for XXX. There are several key roles that we have identified:

* <strong>Logistics</strong> - This person will handle the venue organisation, catering for food/drinks and ensure the event runs smoothly
* <strong>Finances</strong> - The person will liase with the respective stakeholders to finance the event.
* <strong>Marketing/Social Media</strong> - This person will be in charge of marketing the event to the necessary audience through the most appropriate channels (Facebook, Twitter, Telegram etc.) - If your organization has its own Twitter or other social media accounts, you may want to consider giving this person temporary access so they can manage the social media tools for the event.
* <strong>Other</strong>  - Someone responsible for design of promotional material+ development for website if necessary

These roles can be delegated or a sole person can handle all the activities.

## Theme
The best themes are the ones that are most relevant to your  audience and consideration of their expertise in the topic/industry. With the current state of Blockchain technology, there are so many problems that can be solved by leveraging it's protocols and infastructure so finding a theme should be no problem.

Example themes include: Art, Civic, Data, Education, Games, Green Energy, Health, Journalism, Language, Mobile, Movies, Music, Photos, Politics, Robotics, Science, Sports and Water

This theme will tie into what they will be solving and if there are specific APIs / plguisn that will be used ...

Your hackathon attendees will appreciate you putting a lot of thought into your theme 🙂

Below are a list of past Blockathons:

* List of the past Hackathons that we have seen/run XXX ... Provide link...
🔴🔴

## Title and Description
Give your event a catchy name that represents your theme and will stick in the minds of developers/participants.

Provide a detailed, but concise description of your event.  Generally 250-750 characters is sufficient to explain the theme and outcome of the blockathon.

## Format
The formats for hackathons depend on the organisers.  Usually they revolve around two formats:
* Hack Day - 12 to 24 hour timeframe
* Hack Weekend - 24 to 48 hour timeframe
* Online Hack - Any time frame...

Hack Day Example

| Time  | Agenda |
| --- | --- |
| 900-930AM  | Set up of venue   |
| 930-1030AM  | Breakfast + Registration + Welcome  |
| 1030-1100AM  | Introduction + Team Building Exercise |
| 1100-1130AM  | Keynote Talk + Presentation of problem|
| 1130-1200PM  | Team Formation Exercise |
| 1200-1230PM  | Lunch |
| 1230-500PM   | Hack! |
| 500-545PM    | Pitches |
| 545-600PM    | Judges Discussion for winners |
| 600-615PM    | Presentation + Prizes |
| 615-700PM+   | Afterparty drinks |


This represents just a few approaches to formatting a hackathon.  The best way to find out what works is attend other events, and find the characteristics you like best.

## Date and Time
The date can have significant influence on how well it is attended and how much impact it has. Community blockathons are typically held on weekends when people are not working. So it is necessary to choose a date to allow yourself to promote and have the attendees clear their schedule. Also best to avoid any public weekends / holidays as people will be away on vacation during that time. Also make sure that the event does not clash with any other events within the Blockchain community and that it is promoted well in advance. 

For time, clear the schedule of your event to participants in advance. If you choose a 9am start time, expect 20% to show up at 10am. Having an itinerary published at event signup will help make sure you can get started earlier. Schedule reception type activities at the beginning of the day to allow for some late arrivals.

## Venue
The venue is also crucial to the atmosphere of the event. Most blockathons are held in a co-working space or an Innovation Hub area which is easy to get to. The place should also represents the theme of the Blockchain culture of innovation and creating something new for the world!

* Food area + bins 
* Bathrooms
* Accessbility
* Internet
* Size of venue 
* Area to hack
* Security
* OHS 
* Wifi
* Power sockets + safety
* Audio + visual 
* Microphone 
* Projectors
* Enough utensils

Blockathons come in all sizes from as small as 5-10 people to 200 people. Bigger isn't always better, but conducting larger events without proper experience and resources can be a major disaster. Keep size in line with your over goal for throwing a blockathon.

Asking for pre-registration will give you and your team an indication of the number of attendees for the event and how much catering you will have to provide. Using services such as Eventbite or Google Form can help you with this process.

## Budgetting
Understanding your budget is crucial to the running of the event. Most of the budget will be for the food and drinks catering as it is important to keep your attendees full and let them focus on hacking. 

Include Sample Budgetting...
🔴🔴

## Sponsorship
Unless you have a budget for Hackathons, you will want to find a sponsor for your event to cover your costs.  Costs include those for a venue (if you are unable to find a free option), and food.  Your sponsor may be able to provide you with a venue for your event. 

In addition to providing a good working space for your attendees, it’s a good idea to provide plenty of food.  Not only will your attendees appreciate the gesture, but you want them to be able to focus on their projects without the distraction of leaving to get food and drinks.  For a one-day event starting in the morning, be prepared to provide coffee and pastries in the morning, a nutritious lunch with beverages, and snacks, water and cold beverages through the day. 

When you talk to prospective sponsors about your event, they may have never heard of Blockathons.  They will want to know what to expect, so be prepared to explain a bit about Hackathons as well as about your cause.  Think about how they can benefit from your Hackathon so you can explain to them.  Benefits may include:

* Being associated with their brand name
* Being able to meet and talk with the Blockathon attendees
* Having attention paid to their particular business area
* Exposure for their open data efforts
* Having prototype apps created using their API/data

Be sure to let them know that you’d like to thank them publicly for their support, both on your Hackathon web page and via your social media.  Sometimes event sponsors are happy to help out but are not comfortable with the more public forms of gratitude such as Twitter and Facebook, so be sure you have their permission to mention them in social media.  You want to show thanks in a way that works for them.

Part of the benefit of using sponsors is of course covering the costs.  Another benefit is to increase the exposure for your cause, or associate your cause and organization with other organizations.  Remember the reputation of your cause and organization will be affected by the host and sponsor you associate with, and vice versa, so choose organizations that are well respected and easy to work with.  Be respectful, gracious and professional in your interaction with them. 

## Speakers, Judges and Mentors

Speakers, judges and mentors are in important piece of hackathons. Often times they are representing sponsors, but you should consider workshops and other talks that are more informative and help hackathon participants succeed.

Have a structured approach to structuring your speaker line-up.  Provide a framework for speakers to pariticpate in, providing title and abstracts for their talk within a set format and time line you dictate. 

Make sure your speaker line-up is logical and fits well with the theme and schedule of your hackathon.

For Judges and Mentors, these are people who are well respected in the Blockchain community and can offer valuable feedback to the blockathon particpants who are pitching. Judges should range from 3 to 5 individuals. Mentors are any number of individuals  who are available to help out during the hacking and answer any expertise questions the attendees may have on the day.

## Prizes
Not every hack day needs prizes so make sure it's not all about the money/toys. Some people go to hack days to learn, or to play. However if you do choose to award them prizes,make sure it is divisible to encourage teamwork. Commonly in blockathons, it is some cryptocurrencies.

Remember, the hackathon is not about the winner or prizes.  It's about the learning, experience and community :)

## Swag and Merchandise
You may also want to consider getting special tshirts, stickers and other merchandie for your team + attendees if it is within budget. They will serve as a really nice memory for everyone!

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/16810128/36575253-18ca2a66-189e-11e8-9706-25943ec3fedb.jpg"> 

Now that you have planned all the pre-requisites of the Blockathon, now it's time to start marketing the event. The aim of marketing the event is to get as many people to come 'hack' and be a part of the Blockchain community. However, if there are particular groups you would like to have attend (developers or industry experts), you will want to think about where best to reach out to them to be sure they know about the event.

## Landing Page 

A landing page allows you to visually board and design all the necessary information for your Blockathon. It will list all the details you have organised before the event. 

This can be done by creating a github README.md file or a website / landing page. Websites and landing pages can easily be made through services such as Wordpress, Wix, SquareSpace, Unboucne or you can code it yourself 💻

Below is a preview of our landing page:

## Registration

A formal registration process for the hackathon should setup to handle attendees from start to finish. The most commonly tools are Facebook Events, Eventbrite Google Forms. Some required field would be:

* First Name
* Last Name
* Email
* How did you find out about the event?
* Any Dietary requirements?
* Add any other questions / fields that are required for your Blockathon

A registration process will give you the necessary tools to manage your attendees and understand the scope of your event--as well as give your participants the feeling of organization around the whole process. 

The bitfwd 'stack' that has worked well for us has been:
* Creating a Facebook event with the description - This is for awareness
* Creating an Eventbrite ticket or Google Form link for registration and detail collection
* Send an information pack 1 week before the event to all the registrants

For any other 'stacks', feel free to add below for the community :)

🔴🔴

When you require your attendees to register, make it clear what information is required for signing up and what the deadline for the registration is. If there’s a maximum number of attendees the venue can handle, communicate how the selection process works and when/how people will be notified if they’ve been granted attendance or not.

If there’s a waiting list for the event, make sure to explain how it works.

## Distribution and Spreading the Word
The most important part is getting as many participants coming to your event! So distribtion and utiilsing the various social media nad messaging platforms will help you promote your event to the right audience.

Email

Telegram
Within the Blockchain community, Telegram is a very common communication channel... 

Twitter

Now for the fun part of how to run the Blockathon on the day! Initially the organising team should arrive 1 to 1.5 hours before the event starts. (I.e arrive 730-8am if the event starts at 9am)
🔴🔴 Add more text...

## Organising Team 
On the day you will need to assign a few roles to make things run smoothly. It would also be ideal for other people/volunteers to help out with the event to help with the setting up on the venue and ssisiting the attendees for anything they need.

* <strong>Logistics</strong> - This person will handle the venue organisation, catering for food/drinks and ensure the event runs smoothly
* <strong>MC</strong> - The person will help host the introduction of the event and the end of Blockathon pitches
* <strong>Marketing/Social Media</strong> - This person will be in charge of tweeting / posting live updates of the event. If your organization has its own Twitter or other social media accounts, you may want to consider giving this person temporary access so they can manage the social media tools for the event.
* <strong>Other</strong>  - People to help up with the distribution of food and setting up the venue.

## Preparation
This is highly dependant on the venue but there are certain neccesities that 


## Food Considerations 
Low budget: 
- Supermarket - bulk / online deliveries
- Bread / Cereal Milk / 
- Snacks - biscuits / sugar
- Roast chicken for sandies
30 people = $400-500 AUD 

Alcohol - 60 - 80 $10 / pp

Medium
- Order restaurant for deals ( buritos / suhsi / sandiwhces / falafel and wraps / XXX)

High
- High end catering if you want to impress corproate faggots + dollar dollar bills + Champagne every day. 

Food and drink is one of the connecting elements of hackathons.  Spending an entire day or weekend together, solving problems and sharing breakfast, lunch, dinner and late night snacks has a way of bringing people together. [[2](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#2-hack-weekends---httphackweekendscom)]

Make the food at your hackathon a healthy, fulfilling experience for attendees. 

### Support
There should be staff on hand to help users set-up quickly for their demos, such as connecting to the projector. If the equipment at the venue allows it, have one demo presenting while the next is setting up. [4](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#4-the-hack-day-manifesto---httphackdaymanifestocom)]

### Video connectors
For the demos, either have a set of adapters handy for (Apple Mac) Mini DisplayPort, VGA, DVI, and HDMI video outputs, or make sure attendees know the projector’s inputs ahead of time so they can make sure they have the relevant adapters. [4](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#4-the-hack-day-manifesto---httphackdaymanifestocom)]



## Safety

### Emergency plans
Make sure you have a plan for attendees who are injured, fall ill or suffer any other emergencies. Have at least one designated first aider on call. Make sure you know where the first aid box is, and check it’s appropriately stocked. Know the procedures for calling an ambulance, sounding the fire alarm, evacuation point, and logging incidents in the venue. Make sure attendees know who to turn to for help; a phone number, a few bright crew shirts and a central crew desk or wardrobe go a long way. A central point of contact will also help you deal with inevitable electric, network, venue- or food-related questions. [4](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#4-the-hack-day-manifesto---httphackdaymanifestocom)]


## Introduction
As people arrive, welcome them and direct them to the area where you’ll be working and where they can find coffee and snacks.  If you have a photo release form, this is a good time to hand it out, ask them to sign it and return it to you. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

People will arrive at various times regardless of the official start time for your hackathon.  We recommend that you start the event on time, only delaying if you don’t think you have enough people to get started.  Don’t delay the start more than 15 minutes in order to honour the people who arrived on time. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

When it’s time to start, you# should get the attention of the room and give a brief introduction, being sure to cover the following topics: [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

* your name and why you organized the hackathon
* the title and the theme of the hackathon
* a thank you to the participants for attending, and an assurance it will be a fun day
* a thank you to the hosts and sponsors for providing food, space, etc.
* an introduction to open data
* an overview of the day

Optional: Depending on the time available and the number of participants, it is useful to have participants introduce themselves.  Ask them to state their name, something about themselves and what brought them to the hackathon.  This breaks the ice a bit and gives people some context as to who is in the room with them. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

Finally, ask the participants if there are any questions before you get started.  Hackathons are a new concept to many people, just as open data is a new concept.   People may not know exactly what they will be doing, but at least you can give them some idea of the format, so that they can relax and focus on the next task. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]


## Brainstorming

People often approach problems with preconceived ideas about what’s possible, based on what they know and their experiences to date.  This approach is great for survival, but ignores the the realm of knowing called “what you don’t know you don’t know”.  The job of the facilitator in this phase is to expand the realm of what’s possible so that participants can generate ideas that they may not have otherwise allowed themselves to contemplate. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

There is a tendency to be realistic and come up with small, or practical solutions.  While this is fine, and simple solutions are often the best solutions, you want to encourage participants explore everything that’s possible to minimize the impact of the self-imposed limitations they walked into the room with. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

You will want to provide a form or a shared spreadsheet to collect the generated ideas.  Google spreadsheets are perfect for this purpose.  Explain to the participants that they can enter their ideas into the spreadsheet if they want to, but that they don’t have to.  Sometimes people don’t want to record their idea in a public forum, and that’s fine.  The form should have descriptive information in the fields that help people think about some of the attributes and potential effects of their idea. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

Here is an example of what your form could look like: [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

* Title - Project Title
* Description - Brief description of project
* Audience - Who would benefit from this project and roughly how many people would this represent?
* Data - What data is needed?
* Where	Where is the required data? - Past URLs into the data if known.
* Skills - What skills are needed to further this project?
* Considerations - Are there any other considerations? (threats, risks?)
* Similar - Is this project or a similar project being done elsewhere?  Provide URLs if possible.
* Collaborators - Who is working on this project? (names, twitter IDs)  If you prefer not to say, that’s okay too.

Here is a link to the OpenDataBC form: http://goo.gl/Ye3DR  .  Please feel free to use this as an example; however, if you want to actually use it, be aware that your ideas will end up in the OpenDataBC ideas spreadsheet (and, we request that you only use the OpenDataBC spreadsheet if your event is an OpenDataBC sanctioned event). [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

Important: Let participants know that the spreadsheet is public on the internet.  If they don’t want to make their idea public, they may not want to use the tool.  Using the tool is not a requirement, it’s just a tool to help develop ideas and record them for those who want to do that. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

Once you have described the brainstorming process, invite participants to start coming up with ideas.  The more ideas, the better, so if a person has more than one they should record them all.  Also encourage them to discuss their ideas with their neighbours.
Let them know that the brainstorming will take place over the next 30 or so minutes.  Remind them that there is coffee and snacks and that at the end of the brainstorming session you will be inviting them to talk about their ideas with the room. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

Once they have started, ask your room manager to help you wander around the room and chat with people one-on-one to see how they are doing.  Different people engage differently when given an opportunity to brainstorm publicly.  Some will jump right in and will engage with others around them.  Some will want to work on their own.  Some will want to work with others but may feel awkward or shy about getting involved with others.  The hackathon team members can help by simply going around from team to team or person to person and checking in with them, asking how it’s going, if they have thought of something, etc..  Sometimes a suggestion that people work together or for someone to join a team is all it takes to make someone’s experience of the day much more engaging.  A little bit of one-on-one can work wonders for people to get more out of the process. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

The brainstorming session will often take longer than expected.  It takes awhile for people to warm up and for the ideas to start flowing.  Remind people to record their ideas and give periodic reminders about how much time they have left.  Usually, 30 to 45 minutes is sufficient for folks to be ready to move to the next step. [[3](https://github.com/kinlane/hack-weekends-guide#3-open-data-hackathon-how-to-guide---httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentd1fbuisdtiibaz9u2tr7sgv6gddlov_ahbafjqhxsknb0edit)]

## After Event

Even after your event is technically over, there are still opportunities to connect with your participants.  In doing this, you can let other folks who were not able to attend know what happened (and make them wish they hadn’t missed it!).  In addition, it’s another opportunity to thank your participants, recognize what they accomplished through their participation and demonstrate progress toward the overall goals of your cause, in this case, open data.
